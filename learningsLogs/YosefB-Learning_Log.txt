LOG: Decided upon the project. Initialised the project repository. Started 
covering React Tutorial on Freecodecamp to grasp the basics of the framework. 
Have researched the folder structure of projects done using MERN Stack and have 
created initial folder structure for the project. In addition, have communicated 
with the other project contirbutor in regards to the project to discuss the idea.
It has been decided to reproduce an brief webapp flowchart to assist the production
process.

LOG: After learning together how to build application flow-charts, me and another 
project collaborator, we have designed a user experience flowchart using
Lucidchart software. It also very clearly shows the client-side website structure
which will prove to be useful later during the production process. 
So far I am still covering Freecodecamp course and building beginner projects. 
I have grasped a solid understanding of routing and redirects, which will 
be very applicable when designing social media application, as exactly how
flowchart shows, many redirects and routing will be necessary.
