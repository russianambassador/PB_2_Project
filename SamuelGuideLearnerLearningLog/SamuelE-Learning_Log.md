## 22nd of February
I discussed with my project-companion about the project and built flowcharts. These flowcharts were all built with Lucidchart software and they all described the various functions that will be added. For instance, we have discussed about the design of each page which was designed using figma, and we also discussed about the server-side, such as how the login will work. I got to learn that we will be building this app with react, which is a completely new coding experience for me. 

## 5th of March
From when I spoke to my project-companion I have been learning how to code with React by using the twelve hours free react course from freeCodeCamp.org, which I did not finish entirely as I felt that I did not need to know all of it. To solidify what I learnt I started revising the built-in function for react and practing with it using w3schools.com. This has been very helpful as everything was explained properly, however, I won't start coding now for the main project as I feel like I need to know more.

What I learned about React:
* Components
* React Structure
* Routing
* Forms
* useRef and useEffect,useState
* Conditionals
These things that I learned were quite similar to how you would code in javascript, but the React's hooks was where I needed more help with videos of them being used on youtube.

## 12th of March
During this timeframe I have been watching other people building their apps from youtube and, of course, copying it so that I can integrate these concept of React more in me. I feel like I have learned enough and I should now be able to go to the main project as I already know what's my part in the project (login and register).

## 30th of March
I have learned new things and I have finished designing the login page after so many attempts in doing it. I used bootstrap to make my life easier when coding the login and register page but it turned out that I needed more practice with css styling, as I was struggling with containers and positions. After failed attempts with mainly guessing the positions and container adjustment I decided to actually go into w3school to learn, which did not help me as I already knew the definition of most of these css property. Because of this I went more into practical and encountered a video on youtube which built a page with the same concept. I now have to somehow connect database to these pages.

## 31st of March
I designed the register page which was fast to do as it used the same template as the login page, and only had to add a few stuff

## 1st of April
I was able to make the register and login page look the way I wanted it to. I also added a functionality to my my page template using eventListeners, which makes the left border of the box go green when the mouse goes on top and go back to normal when the mouse is removed from there.

## 5th of April
I applied node.js and express.js to my login and register by watching a tutorial, from Dev and Design, on youtube, which was extremelly helpfull. I also learnt how to use http and axios, which I had to give a further look as I kept on struggling to get it to work on my project.

## 10th of April
I delayed the submission of my work because I assumed that I was also going to add code related to database. During this timeframe I have been watching a youtube video on how to add mongoose database which took me time as I did not know how to implement it to my project. After many trial and error I received news that I shouldn't be working on the database so I stopped what I was doing and pushed the code to the git repository. This has caused me to waste a lot of time but I learned about adding database to your code in react.
