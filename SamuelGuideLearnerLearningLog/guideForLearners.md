## Motivation
React is a JavaScript framework and amongst the easiest one to learn, which makes it advantageous on the aspect of deployment time. Hence, if you are in need to build a mobile app in a short timeframe then React might be the best choice for you. Another aspect that makes React stand out even more is the ability to reuse components. A component is any piece of UI used in application, and these can be navigation bars or input bars. This aspect greatly contributes to the reduction of deployment time, as it removes the need to recode the same UI multiple time.

Example of a famous application built with React are Facebook, Dropbox, Netflix and many others. This is to say that even with React you can build astonishing application which have possibility to take the attention of a massive audience.

## Background
Before starting with React, you should remember that react is a **JavaScript framework**, therefore you should at least know how to code with JavaScript, and of course html and CSS. There are many free courses on the internet where you can learn JavaScript, such as in YouTube. 

My advice for people who have not coded before is to watch free tutorial from freeCodeCamp, this makes you take things nice and slowly. On the other hand, if you have coded before and know the basics of languages, then to learn quickly you should visit w3schools and go through anything you need to know. To solidify all this knowledge gained you should work on a simple interactive website. Bootstrap can aid you in building a website, as it has many already coded components which can be modified with styling. This decreases development time, as the time you would use in coding the same component several times will be avoided.

## Learning Material
Firstly, before learning how to code with React you should have a good understand on how to work with npm registry and how to install packages using npm. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHDhaSSKmB0) tutorial will describe what npm is and teach you how to use npm's commands. Popular npm packages are Node.js and Express.js, which is a framework based on Node.js. To learn about Node.js watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBNz5xF-Kx4), where the fundamental is not overlooked but instead but carefully explained.

As mentioned before, there are many free courses on the internet that will teach you all the fundamentals you need to know. A highly recommended course would be [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4&t=2283s) free course from freeCodeCamp, where you will be taught about hooks, React API, React Router and the fundamentals. The course is a ten-hour video and by far the most comprehensive course you will find on YouTube. Another option would be to learn React on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp), where everything you need to know is explained in details, with examples and practical questions. Questions taken from w3schools will not be enough for you to solidify your React skills, therefore is important you practice your skills by building simple applications. The best way to learn how to build an application is to watch somebody else make one, a good example is this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCA4qpQDZD8), where you will learn how to build a todo application and also shows you situation where your code can go wrong.

MongoDB is a database program used by many and is classified as a NoSQL database program. Its schemas are flexible and easy to use which makes it stand out amongst every other database. Watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofme2o29ngU) short video you will understand how to download MongoDB and learn the basics, such as inserting and deleting. To gain further knowledge, you might want to navigate through [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/index.htm), which provides detailed explanations from beginner to advanced level. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQqSMDIzhaE&t=1042s) tutorial will put in practice everything you learnt with MongoDB, React and Node, and will explain each taken to build a Sign-Up application.

## Evaluation

With the skills learnt from this guide you will be able to build an astonishing application, websites and platforms. The ability to use database alongside React has given you the ability to do so much more with the project you will build. Although the process to master everything mentioned in the previous sections is long and require a lot of practice, it is very worth it. It makes you, the developer, to gain more coding experience, it helps you save time in the long-run, and it gives you a good starting point when doing mobile development. In my opinion, React has been worth my time and I am excited to learn more of it in the future. However, because I am not too much of a JavaScript expert, I feel like I should have learnt Vue instead of React as it is a better choice for newer developer and also has a better performance.
