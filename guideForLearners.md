## MOTIVATION:
![alt text](https://webimages.mongodb.com/_com_assets/cms/mern-stack-b9q1kbudz0.png?auto=format%2Ccompress)
[**MERN**](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack) abbreviates for [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/), [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html), [**React**](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and [**Node**](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/) – it is a stack of 4 technologies, which together lay out a foundation for building full-stack applications. In general, to develop a full stack application you must be equipped with a diverse skillset and be knowledgeable of multiple languages and technologies, whereas in MERN-based applications, server-side and client-side can be built with the knowledge of JavaScript on its own, making MERN stack an ideal way of entering the field of full-stack development. MERN is a modern way of developing full-stack applications, which inevitably will become more popular along with ever-increasing computational powers of our computers and storing capacities of cloud storages, as it is convenient to be able to have a unique production environment for both client-side and server-side to allow more efficient testing and debugging. My personal motivations to learn MERN were concerned with the ease of deploying various start-ups using this technological stack.

## BACKGROUND:

 Below, the guidance to learn MERN will be provided, and it will suit those readers who have not yet met React.js before, as well as those who have not yet used any cloud MongoDB clusters to store their applications data. Those readers who have a solid understanding of React.js and MongoDB may find some parts of this guidance needless and are not expected to follow them, though it is still advised to review some contents. 

As can be inferred from above, to get the full understanding of guidance that will follow, it is expected from the reader to have a solid knowledge of the foundations of JavaScript. 
Furthermore, basic knowledge of document-orientated databases would be beneficial for a clearer understanding of concepts reader will meet along when learning about MongoDB. 
Finally, it is recommended to know the basics of APIs and how interaction with them happens. 

The reader can fill the gaps in knowledge by utilizing the following resources:
* [Full JavaScript Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg&t=385s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)– a great short introductory course into JavaScript.
* [MDN JS Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) – a well-written JavaScript documentation to learn from or refer to.
* [Great introductory video into document-orientated databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0buKQHokLK8&ab_channel=SimplyExplained) – learn about NoSQL databases.
* [Introduction to APIs by Freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) – a great and detailed video about APIs, interaction with APIs and how they are built.


## LEARNING MATERIALS:

Before actually learning to combine technologies in the tech-stack, it is recommended to review them separately to make sure they are understood. My suggestion is that an easy start to would be getting familiar with Node.js – a JavaScript runtime environment - and its framework – Express.js.
* Node.js development has become very popular over the last four years; hence many learning resources were generated by the ever-increasing community of developers using the technology, allowing for a smooth learning experience. The following are resources I have found useful when learning Node.js:
    * [This is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLtyhwFtXQA&t=338s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) a masterpiece done by Freecodecamp.org that gently introduces to all major concepts surrounding Node.js and leads learners into the use of Express.js framework. I highly recommend this video for the high amount of useful technical details mentioned in there. 
    * [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) was also highly useful resource, as all explanation there are very clear and condensed and all the concepts are covered in a reasonable pace. 

    * Node.js also provides built-in package manager called npm, to allow users install different packages, configure them and manage dependency conflicts. Npm is necessary to install the majority of frameworks associated with JavaScript and Node.js and hence I recommend going through [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHDhaSSKmB0&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) to get a good understanding of what npm is. (npm is an analogue of another package manager that may be more familiar to the reader – yarn. They carry identical functionality and using yarn instead of npm would not conflict with this guide). 

* Express.js provides a lot of features to simplify production using Node.js and hence why it is recommended to use it in all cases when building an API or a web application unless it does obscure certain Node.js features which are necessary. There are many great video tutorials that can be found on YouTube and the reader is encouraged to check [them all](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=express.js+tutorial) out to find which tutorials suit her/him well, whereas here are resources I have found useful when I was learning Express.js - [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9WUkeYSA8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU&index=6&ab_channel=TheNetNinja) is a great and condensed introduction to the concept. It would suit well the readers who want to get a brief overview of the technology and then learn it on the go. This was my approach to learning Express.js, though at times when I got stuck, a [very well-detailed tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/expressjs/index.htm), with lots of examples and very clear explanations was there to help. It covers every necessary topic to build a solid understanding of Express.js, as well as talks about best practices of using the technology.

* MongoDB is a popular cross-platform database technology which has found many applications in many various fields and hence I have found its documentation rather confusing at the start – it was hard to navigate to the right place and find a starting point through seemingly endless lines of explanations. Hence why, I recommend starting off with a video tutorial which introduces to the main concepts and teaches how to use MongoDB together with Node.js, such as [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-WEoTjWzFQ&list=PL1QozeBXRrorzx0XKIEYp3IVLuHaDqVu0&index=24&ab_channel=programminglite) – it smoothly introduces MongoDB and teaches how to use it with express application and also is a playlist to learn, or review various topics in Express.js and Node.js. To get a more clear view of how MongoDB is used in projects, I recommend following through [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1Kttu53qTg&ab_channel=DailyTuition) which combines everything that was covered in this guide so far, to produce a CRUD application (Create, Read, Update and Delete). Nevertheless, I suggest that reviewing [documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/introduction/) is necessary, as it explains many concepts in a way that was originally intended by the creators of the technology and unfortunately it is unlikely that the reader could ever find more detailed explanations of the majority of concepts anywhere else. 

* React.js is a JavaScript framework which is usually utilized to build dynamic user interfaces using component model. This technology is well-maintained by Meta and a big community of individual developers, hence why it has a very well written [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) which I recommend using for learning. It starts from the very basics and goes through simple introductory projects and then it smoothly and clearly guides the user through all the concepts of the technology. Additionally, there are many excellent YouTube tutorials offering amazing introductions to the key concepts of the technology such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dorf8i6lCuk&t=1027s&ab_channel=Academind) – it goes through topics sequentially, going from the very basics to more advanced ideas while working on the example project. During my learning of MERN, React was my biggest focus as I have already had some prior knowledge of Node.js and Express.js and hence I chose to spent more hours learning and practicing this framework, hence why, my personal recommendation is to pay additional attention to topics such as [“Rules of Hooks”](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) and [“Components Life Cycle”](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html), as the lack of knowledge in those usually leads to long hours of debugging, whereas if these topics are well-understood it will be much easier to generate faster solutions to different problems regarding building a component. 

 Finally, as 4 key technologies were learnt, it is now possible to complete the technology stack by combining them. [This resource](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mern-stack-tutorial) I have found the most valuable regarding the basics of MERN stacks and how setup the project. It contains many useful visualizations of the way technologies in the stack are interconnected, as well as mentions analogue technology stacks, such as MEVN or MEAN. Additionally, I have found [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldGl6L4Vktk&list=PLj-4DlPRT48lXaz5YLvbLC38m25W9Kmqy&ab_channel=LamaDev) particularly useful in terms of learning how to build MERN-based applications, as it does not teaches technologies from scratch while doing the project, but assumes some prior knowledge and uses rather advanced concepts, which is a great way to consolidated knowledge of MERN stack.

## EVALUATION:

In my personal opinion MERN is a very useful skill to learn. As was mentioned at the start of this guide, MERN stack is a great tool to be able to build full-stack applications, which are easily debugged and tested – this makes it a great tool for beginners to dive into a full stack development and to begin thinking like a full stack development. Furthermore, learning MERN brings a solid understanding of how multiple frameworks may be combined to generate a powerful technological stack other than MERN and this is a very valuable skill to possess as it makes the developer more versatile in terms of what she/he uses during production. In my case, learning MERN was completely worth it, as I could apply my knowledge to real-life projects straight away, however, I do realise that there are many existing and efficient alternatives to MERN-based applications  - [MEAN](https://www.mongodb.com/mean-stack) and [MEVN](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-mevn-stack) which were mentioned earlier, or [LAMP](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/lamp-stack-explained) stack – all of these are used in the production of web applications as well.
